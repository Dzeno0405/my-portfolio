          <h2>Airsoft Club Page</h2>
          <p>
            I plan to create a fully functional and visually appealing website for my Airsoft club,

          <h2>Online Store Example</h2>
          <p>
            I will develop an example of an online store to demonstrate my skills in e-commerce development, 
            including a responsive design, product pages, and a working shopping cart.
